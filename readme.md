**StudyGroupNFT**

## Project Description

**StudyGroupNFT** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum that incentivizes student participation in study group sessions through blockchain technology. The contract tracks attendance for students in study groups, rewarding them with **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** once they reach a predefined attendance threshold (e.g., 5 sessions). Students who participate actively in the study group sessions are rewarded with NFTs that act as proof of achievement and can be used for further incentives or gamification.

The contract also includes a simple reward system that allows students to earn ERC-20-like tokens based on their participation. This system provides an engaging and transparent way to motivate students to be consistent in their learning journey.

## Project Vision

The **StudyGroupNFT** project aims to integrate blockchain technology into the education and study group ecosystem by creating a system where students are rewarded for their active participation. Through the use of NFTs and token rewards, we seek to:

- **Enhance student engagement**: By providing tangible rewards (NFTs), students are motivated to attend and actively participate in study sessions.
- **Encourage consistency**: Students are incentivized to maintain regular attendance to unlock NFT rewards, making learning more gamified and enjoyable.
- **Offer a transparent and immutable record of achievements**: Using blockchain, all records of attendance and NFT awards are public and tamper-proof.
- **Build an ecosystem for educational rewards**: The system can be extended to provide further token-based rewards, community interactions, and even integrations with other platforms.

Ultimately, the goal is to bridge the gap between education and decentralized technology by providing a new way for students to be rewarded for their commitment and participation.

## Key Features

- **Attendance Tracking**: The contract keeps track of each student's attendance. Once the student reaches the predefined attendance threshold (default is 5 sessions), they are eligible to receive an NFT.
  
- **NFT Minting**: When a student reaches the attendance threshold, a **unique NFT** is minted and assigned to the student. These NFTs serve as proof of achievement.
  
- **Token Rewards**: The contract allows for **ERC-20-like token rewards**. Students can earn tokens for attending study sessions, which can be transferred or saved for future use.
  
- **Owner Control**: Only the contract owner (e.g., the study group organizer or administrator) can mark attendance, mint NFTs, and issue token rewards, ensuring that the system is secure and controlled.
  
- **Customizable Attendance Threshold**: The threshold for awarding NFTs (e.g., the number of sessions a student needs to attend) is configurable, allowing flexibility based on the study groupâ€™s requirements.
  
- **Transparency and Immutability**: All records of attendance and NFT awards are stored on the blockchain, providing a transparent, immutable record of achievements for students.
  
- **Student Achievements**: Students can track how many sessions they've attended and which NFTs they've earned through functions like `getAttendance` and `tokensOfOwner`.
